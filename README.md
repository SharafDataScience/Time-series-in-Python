# Time-series-in-Python
Air Pollution in Delhi, India – Time Series Forecasting  This project analyzes air pollution levels in Delhi, India using time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA and SARIMA. The notebook provides data preprocessing, statistical testing, and model building to understand and predict air pollution patterns.
air pollution patterns.

# Project Overview
Objective: Forecast air pollution in Delhi based on historical data.

Techniques: Time Series Analysis, ARIMA, SARIMA.

# Key Steps:

- Load and preprocess the dataset

- Perform stationarity tests (ADF / Dickey–Fuller)

- Identify model parameters (p, d, q)

- Fit ARIMA and SARIMA models

- Evaluate model performance

- Visualize results and forecasts

# Results
- Time series decomposition and visualization of Delhi air pollution trends.

- Forecasts generated using ARIMA and SARIMA models.

- Model comparison and evaluation metrics.

# Future Work
- Extend to seasonal decomposition of additional pollutants.

- Try advanced models (Prophet, LSTM, or other deep learning approaches).
